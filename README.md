# TPSS
The TPSS, a simulator written in Java, is an abbreviation for the the DNA-tiles Pattern Self-replication Simulator. For more details about the simulation, please see the white paper: https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnx2aW5heWdhdXRhbWJpb3N5c3RlbXN8Z3g6NzE0N2RiMDhjYzg5OGI5ZQ
The TPSS comes in two versions: aTPSS and kTPSS, where prefixes, 'a' and 'k' are used to denote abstract model and kinetic model, respectively. To run: use the AbstractWrapper.Java for aTPSS and KineticWrapper.Java for kTPSS.
