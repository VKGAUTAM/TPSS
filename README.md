The TPSS, a simulator written in Java, is an abbreviation for the the DNA-tiles Pattern Self-replication Simulator. For more details about the simulator, please see the article (https://www.proquest.com/docview/2317938315/3C307FF5B278441BPQ/20?accountid=27468)
The TPSS comes in two versions: aTPSS and kTPSS, where prefixes, 'a' and 'k' are used to denote abstract model and kinetic model, respectively. To run the simulation: use the AbstractTPSWrapper.Java for aTPSS and KineticTPSWrapper.Java for kTPSS.
